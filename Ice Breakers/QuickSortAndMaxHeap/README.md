##Quicksort and Heap class 

**Purpose**
	+ Rewrites a max heap class and calculate its insertion/removal CPU runtime
	+ Implement two types of quicksort and test them using Grading.cpp
		+ Method 1: Quicksort using random pivot
		+ Method 2: Quicksort using end pivot

**Run Instructions**:
  + Type "make" to compile all programs
  	+ Quicksort.cpp, Grading.cpp, MaxHeap.cpp
  + Classes are not separated into header files; all tests are performed in main() in the cpp files
